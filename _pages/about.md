ðŸ˜„ I am a Ph.D. Candidate and Research/Teaching Assistant in the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering & Agricultural and Biological Engineering at Purdue University. My advisor is Prof. [Somali Chaterji](https://schaterji.io/). I also collaborate closely with Prof. [Saurabh Bagchi](https://bagchi.github.io/) and Prof. [Yin Li](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~yli/).
My research interests include optimizing the performance and energy efficiency of Machine Learning Systems (MLSys) on diverse computing platforms, such as embedded GPUs, server GPUs, and AI Accelerators. Recently, I have been working on several projects targeting performance and energy optimization for Large Language Models (LLMs) and Computer Vision (CV) applications on embedded GPUs and AI Accelerators. I am passionate about leveraging my expertise to address real-world problems, particularly through researching, developing, and deploying cutting-edge intelligent systems and softwares. My goal is to optimize latency, accuracy, and energy efficiency for intelligent computer systems, contributing to environmental sustainability.
